Answer Key & Rationale

1. Answer: D. The patient is exhibiting signs of CO2 narcosis (drowsiness) due to excessive oxygen, which suppresses their hypoxic drive to breathe. The priority is to reduce the oxygen and re-evaluate their respiratory status. Increasing oxygen would be dangerous.

2. Answer: B. The first rule of ventilator alarms is to assess the patient first, then the machine. The alarm could be due to a patient-related issue like coughing, biting the tube, or bronchospasm. Assessing the airway is the top priority.

3. Answer: C. Celiac disease requires a strict gluten-free diet. Whole wheat bread contains gluten. The other options are gluten-free and appropriate. This demonstrates a lack of understanding.

4. Answer: B. The liver is a highly vascular organ. Positioning the patient on their right side applies direct pressure to the biopsy site, which helps prevent bleeding and hemorrhage, the most significant risk post-procedure.

5. Answer: B. The bronchodilator (Albuterol) should always be used first to open the airways. This allows the corticosteroid (Fluticasone) to penetrate deeper into the lungs and be more effective. Rinsing the mouth is done after using the steroid inhaler.

6. Answer: B. Instructing the patient to void immediately before the procedure is the highest priority. A full bladder is at risk of being accidentally punctured by the needle during fluid aspiration.

7. Answer: C. Stridor is the classic sign of a severe upper airway obstruction and is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention.

8. Answer: B, D, E. Active TB requires airborne precautions. This includes a negative pressure room (B) and a fitted N95 respirator for healthcare staff (D). Standard hand hygiene is always required (E). A surgical mask (A) is inadequate for the nurse. The patient wears a surgical mask for transport, not an N95 (C).

9. Answer: C. The correct sequence is Inspection, Auscultation, Percussion, Palpation (I-A-P-P). Auscultation is performed before percussion and palpation to avoid altering the frequency and character of bowel sounds.

10. Answer: C. Barium can harden and cause a bowel obstruction (impaction). The priority is to flush the barium from the GI tract by increasing fluid intake. White stools are an expected finding, not a problem to report immediately.

11. Answer: C. Crackles, edema, and shortness of breath are classic signs of fluid volume excess, which is common in CHF when the heart cannot pump effectively, causing fluid to back up into the lungs and peripheral tissues.

12. Answer: D. In liver failure, the liver cannot convert ammonia (a byproduct of protein metabolism) into urea for excretion. Ammonia is neurotoxic, and high levels lead to hepatic encephalopathy, manifesting as confusion and disorientation.

13. Answer: D. In the acute phase of diverticulitis (inflammation of the pouches), the goal is to rest the bowel. A low residue/low fiber diet reduces stool bulk and irritation. A high fiber diet is used for prevention (diverticulosis) but is contraindicated during an acute flare-up.

14. Answer: C. A low-pressure alarm indicates a leak or disconnection in the system. The other options (mucus plug, biting, water) would cause an obstruction, triggering a high-pressure alarm.

15. Answer: B. The purpose of an incentive spirometer is to encourage sustained, deep inhalation to expand the alveoli and prevent atelectasis. Blowing out is for a peak flow meter.

16. Answer: D. These are classic signs of an air embolism. The immediate priority is to trap the air in the right ventricle. This is achieved by placing the patient on their left side in the Trendelenburg (head down) position. Clamping the line prevents more air from entering.

17. Answer: B. Bile, produced by the liver, gives stool its characteristic brown color. When the liver is failing or there is a bile duct obstruction, bile does not reach the intestine. The lack of bile prevents fat digestion, leading to fatty, foul-smelling, clay-colored stools (steatorrhea).

18. Answer: C. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid. Red meat, organ meats, and shellfish are high in purines, which are metabolized into uric acid. These foods should be avoided.

19. Answer: B, D. To manage GERD, patients should avoid triggers like caffeine and chocolate (B) and elevate the head of the bed (D) to use gravity to keep acid down. Lying down after meals (A), eating large meals (C), and wearing tight clothing (E) will all worsen reflux symptoms.

20. Answer: B. A positive PPD test indicates that the person's immune system has been exposed to the TB bacillus at some point and has developed antibodies. It does not differentiate between a latent infection and active disease. An AFB sputum test is needed to confirm active TB.`;
